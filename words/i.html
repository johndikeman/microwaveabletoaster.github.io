		<div class='story'><tab>Not much of the waning sunlight made it through the cloudy windows. The few lucky rays that survived the ordeal were forever altered, bouncing sluggishly against the vaguely claustrophobic walls and somehow leaving the bitter taste of rust in the mouth of any person they were unlucky enough to contact. A man sits behind a bar, polishing glasses and waiting for the algal lights to slowly drown out the brave, corrupted evening sun. The establishment has been around for a while. A good, long while. It hasn't changed much, either- the old man makes sure of that. Only when it was made to did it adopt the lights- standard issue after the old fuels became inaccessible. The old man liked the old lights better. They were more dependable, and he didn't have to feed them. The lights pulsed in and out, slowly transforming the grizzled patrons from dark-eyed, shadowy denizens of the old world to bleached, yellow, cheaply preserved cadavers and back again. Heaven knows why these people are here. (Or rather, Heaven knew). They clutch their glasses like insects clinging to the window of a moving hover train, trying desperately to hold onto their memories of how things used to be. They all knew they could do better at the bar two blocks down. Better drinks, better atmosphere, better everything. But the place, with its shiny stools and its clean tables and the thing there- the human being that some other, smarter human being folded up and programmed into a mainframe- wasn't right. But none feared the entity more than the man behind the counter himself. It was unnatural. Every evening, it powered off and died, only to be resurrected by the attendant's finger on the power button the next morning. Born and reborn, an endless cycle. Like something. The old man racked his brain- what was it? Neurons fired into empty synapses, his thoughts became cloudy again. Frustration.<br>
		"Dominic!"<br>
		<tab>Dom would know. The work they did to stop his aneurysm- they put in all sorts of little gadgets. Quantum circuits, all wound up and crammed into his skull like so much tinsel in a cold, hard jar. <br>
		<tab>"Yeah boss?"<br>
		<tab>Dom poked his head out of the door to his office.<br>
		<tab>"Whatsat thing- the mythological whatsit- whatsat thing that dies and, y'know, comes back to life?"<br>
		<tab>"You mean Jesus?"<br>
		<tab>"No, not him. Itsa bird, or somethin'. Ashes? Ring a bell?"<br>
		<tab>Dom's brain flew through its data banks, literally faster than the speed of light.<br>
		<tab>"Oh, a phoenix?"<br>
		<tab>That was it. A phoenix.<br>
		<tab>"Yeah yeah, thatsa one."<br>
		<tab>"What about it?"<br>
		<tab>"Nothin'. Nothin' importint."<br>
		<tab>He looked down at his glass, polished to perfection. He had forgotten why a phoenix was important. He squeezed his eyes shut, and held the glass so tightly he thought it might break. So tightly he could feel it in his old, brittle bones. The light danced around the inside of the cup and flew into his face, mocking him and his weak, meaty brains. He decided he liked that thought, the phoenix. It was a relic from his past self, something he valued, yet let escape him. He tucked it away, into his decaying memory once more. A single bead of sweat detached itself from his brow and fell, sparkling, until it died magnificently at the bottom of the glass. It would have to be washed again. The old man didn't mind. He had all the time in the world. The door opened. Nothing much surprised this old man, but this occurrence managed. By this time in the night, nobody new entered the bar. All the regulars were accounted for. This was out of the ordinary. Through the door came a man. He wore clothes, clothes that were somehow as unmemorable as they were attention grabbing. His face and eyes betrayed no reaction to the dismal scene inside the bar, and he wore a peculiar ring through a piercing in his nose. He walked, purposefully yet indifferently, to the bar. The old man regarded him. He inquired of his nose ring, which became even more troubling to look at up close- the light seemed to regret leaving the thing.<br>
		<tab>"It's a black hole," the man informed him.<br>
		<tab>Brow furrowed, the old man turned this over in his head.<br>
		<tab>"Why hasn't it- y'know- gotten biggeh?"<br>
		<tab>"It's small, and it's reached a sort of equilibrium, I think. It's happy with what the universe has provided it."<br>
		<tab>"Yew talk like tha thing has uh soul."<br>
		<tab>The man leaned in closer.<br>
		<tab>"You talk like you have a soul."<br>
		<tab>"Hm." He had no answer for that.<br>
		<tab>The man ordered his drink and took it back to a booth, where he slowly took care of it. The old man couldn't get rid of an uneasy feeling he couldn't quite put a finger on. The night wore on, and soon the strange man slumped onto the table, asleep. This wasn't a rare occurrence with the old man's regular patrons; he decided to let him rest. A few hours passed, and all the glasses were methodically dried, polished, and returned to their homes on the shelf. The morning sun began its pilgrimage across the sky like it always had- crawling over the tops of the buildings and pulling itself slowly up to Heaven, sending fresh, warm light shooting into the bar like fireworks that ricocheted off the glasses, through the old man's bones, and everywhere else in a heartbeat- lingering only for a moment inside a certain patron's head. The old man figured it was high time to get this fellow out of his bar- he had been there all night. He shuffled his way across the old, sentimental floors- stopping only for a moment to catch his breath. He shook the man lightly. No response. He shook him harder. Nothing. He felt his pulse- nothing. The man was dead. His old, wrinkled hands shaking, he took a handful of the corpse's hair and lifted it up to face him.<br> 
		Nothingness stared back at him. The black hole that he dared adorn his face with had consumed him, neatly and entirely. There was something poetic about the whole situation, the old man considered, backing away from the remains. His meaty brain searched for the answer, but found only the vague promise of a memory long lost to time, that which was almost close enough to reach, that the subconscious ensured its ability to recall later. He shuffled into Dom's office.<br><br>

		<tab>Maybe he could recall whatever it was he had forgotten.
