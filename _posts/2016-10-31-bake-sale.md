Opinion: racist folks selling baked goods at lower prices for minorities is actually a good thing. Yeah, I know they were satirizing affirmative action, and I'd like to throw out that I think affirmative action is great. But this whole hullaballoo sorta feeds into an idea that I've had for a good while- satire is just a really really bad vehicle for political praxis. There's [a pretty good bit on The Onion](http://www.theonion.com/blogpost/why-cant-anyone-tell-im-wearing-this-business-suit-11185) that does a pretty good job at expressing what I'm getting at- it's the story of a hipster who buys a fancy, tailored suit and wears it around ironically. He proceeds to get an ironic job at a law firm and have two ironic kids- all the while laughing at the idea that anyone would ever take his elaborate joke seriously. The meta-irony, if you will, is that the dude just spent his entire life unironically doing the things that he intended to make fun of or whatever. Really, there isn't anything intrinsically inflammatory about what the racists were doing- why not just interpret it as the YCT-UT coming out in favor of reparations? To be fair, the perfect own would have been if some Native American just came up and took all of their cookies. But no, all the liberals had to pitch a fit and now there's a [HuffPo](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/affirmative-action-bake-sale_us_58111afbe4b0390e69ce147c) article about it.

Oh, and then there's this:

I uhh. Wow. If you... if you disagree that hard, why would you dona- y'know what? Nevermind.
